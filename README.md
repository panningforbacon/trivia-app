# A Trivia App
Using websocks (via Socket.IO), this app allows 1 host to ask a question to multiple players, they submit their open text answers, the host evaluates which are correct, points are assigned, and scores are shown. Lather, rinse, repeat for as many questions as you want.

# This is my first web app..
To date, I've only made little scrips to automate things at work here and there. During Covid19 quarantine, I thought this would be an easy project to create a fun app to use with my friends.

It's not as easy as I thought.

But I'm having a blast in the process.
